# Suiteshare

This app integrates your store with the Suiteshare platform, adding the whatsapp widget to all pages.

The Suiteshare widget provides the customer an easy access for communication through Whatsapp and includes several configurations, triggers, and personalized messages which can be fully customized on their platform.

Suiteshare is a sales and service platform for WhatsApp, creating solutions to attract and capture more customers, organize the supports teams demands, and analyze the results to find out where your customers are coming from and optimize your campaigns.

## Getting Started

After installing the app through the store, go to the app settings and type your Suiteshare Id. You can find that on the main Suiteshare dashboard, it's the last code on the installation instructions:
